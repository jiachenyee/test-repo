```
![image with space](image%20with%20space.png)

Couldn't find a good image so I just screenshot the new repository screen.

# The Issue
## Steps to recreate
1. Visit this repository on the GitHub iOS app
2. Only 1 image will show up, the image on top
3. The second image doesn't appear as it has spaces within the file name, however, on web, the images appear fine.
